To replace the TF model from ChromBPNet with the DREAM models (or any other model), you'll need to clone the original [ChromBPNet repository](https://github.com/kundajelab/chrombpnet).

Place train_modified.py under chrombpnet/training/ <br />
Place dream_rnn.py under chrombpnet/training/models/ <br />
Place dream_rnn_with_bias_model.py under chrombpnet/training/models/ <br />
Place train_dream_rnn.py under the cloned repo
