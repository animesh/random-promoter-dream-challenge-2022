## Getting Started

This section contains the code for running the DREAM-optimized models on MPRA data from [Agarwal et. al 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.05.531189v1.full) and can be used for any sequence-to-expression settting (single-task).

If you want to use this code on your data, format your data according to this [sample file](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/random-promoter-dream-challenge-2022/blob/main/benchmarks/human/data/sample_train.txt) and follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/random-promoter-dream-challenge-2022/blob/main/benchmarks/human/DREAMNets_buildModel_Train_Predict.ipynb).

Note: reverse orientation should have `_Reversed:` in its ID.
